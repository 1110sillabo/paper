=The Social Smart contract=

==Abstract==

The lack of contemporaneous political systems able to address citizens’ needs without corrupted mechanisms requires to build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete. On this paper we propose how to organize society and eradicate the corruption of traditional governments by connecting public resources to a democratic system using smart contracts. As humanity approaches Earth’s carrying capacity with an expected population of 10 billion by 2100 we see indispensable the creation of a blockchain based organization for planetary governance that can guarantee preservation of life and natural resources in an age where intelligence is breaking apart from organisms. We detail how to build a blockchain based democracy on a networked commons enforceable with encryption and we offer a path to fund this decentralized government with a rights offering mechanism (analogous to Initial Coin Offerings) that will use its assets to strengthen the political role of the internet across all jurisdictions.
