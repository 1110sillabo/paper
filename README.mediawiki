=The Social Smart Contract.=
An Initial Rights Offering from [http://democracy.earth Democracy Earth Foundation].

==Abstract.==

The lack of contemporaneous political systems able to address citizens’ needs without corrupted mechanisms requires to build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete. On this paper we propose how to organize society and eradicate the corruption of traditional governments by connecting public resources to a democratic system using smart contracts. As humanity approaches Earth’s [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_capacity carrying capacity] with an expected population of 10 billion by 2100 we see indispensable the creation of a blockchain based organization for planetary governance that can guarantee preservation of life and natural resources in an age where [https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464310 intelligence is breaking apart from organisms]. We detail how to build a blockchain based democracy on a networked commons enforceable with encryption and we offer a path to fund this decentralized government with a rights offering mechanism (analogous to Initial Coin Offerings) that will use its assets to strengthen the political role of the internet across all jurisdictions.


==1. Introduction.==

Current democratic systems governing societies under the territorial domain of Nation-States have grown stagnant in terms of participation and are leading towards increased polarization. Constituencies are provided with tailor-made media that satisfies their own endogamic beliefs, pulling society apart as discourse has factual debate replaced by a post-truth mindset. This is a consequence of the drastic expansion in communication channels that shrank attention spans rendering thoughtful analysis expendable. Instances of political participation in the so-called modern democracies are not apt for information abundant contexts and have remained without change since their inception.

Engagement through the traditional channels is weaker among younger generations, [http://www.economist.com/news/essays/21596796-democracy-was-most-successful-political-idea-20th-century-why-has-it-run-trouble-and-what-can-be-do often not going out to vote and unlikely to engage in party politics]. Meanwhile online activism is increasing with social media becoming the dominant arena for political clashes. This includes Facebook and Twitter (where gossip dissemination is predominant with ''fake news'', ''bots'' and ''trolling'' among other campaign optimizations) and emergent eco chambers like [http://www.4chan.org/ 4chan.org] where anonymity led to political incorrectness or [https://gab.ai/ gab.ai] consolidating the ''alt-right'' community in the US. Needless to say: endogamy only makes polarization stronger and no solution is in sight within these services but rather the risk of reinforcing present scenario of tribal polar societies relativizing truth while [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/climate/trump-paris-climate-agreement.html risking preservation of resources].

Democratic processes seen during high-stakes elections are often prone to fraudulent behavior with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering ''gerrymandering''] becoming commonplace and a strong link between what the [https://www.ineteconomics.org/uploads/papers/WP_48_Ferguson_et_al.pdf major political parties spend and the percentage of votes they win]. In developing nations exploits are literal having ballot boxes burnt by large parties to suffocate the chances of smaller competitors. 

This paper proposes a solution that will tackle both, the political and technical issues currently weakening the prospects of democracy in the world by offering an alternative that can be adopted directly by citizens and implemented using peer to peer networks. As the internet becomes the dominant force in modern politics we see an indispensable need to develop digital technology for voting that can be securely deployed in any geographical location and for communities of any size. With internet growth [http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32884867 reaching over 3 billion lives] (far surpassing major religions and Nation-States) and the development of encrypted networks known as blockchains permitting incorruptible transactions with permissionless audits, there’s no reason stopping mankind from building a borderless commons that can help shape the next evolutionary leap for democratic governance.

In a world that has succeeded in the globalization of financial assets while keeping political rights enclosed to limited territories, new forms of governance must acknowledge the networked commons connecting humanity and progressively weakening the legacy of national frontiers unable to address pressing issues such as climate change, rising inequality, terrorism, automation and migrations. Uneven distribution of opportunity around the globe due to the perpetual confrontation between national governments led to the rise of these issues in the global agenda. We believe the technology stack that includes [http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf Bitcoin] as programmable money without Central Banks and [http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/index.html Ethereum] enabling smart contracts without the need of Judiciary Courts requires a third layer that signals incorruptible votes beyond the boundaries of Nation-States. This transnational network will act in accordance to the personal sovereignty of its members and protect their human rights with encryption.

Our technology is a '''''blockchain liquid democracy''''', a method that enables direct voting on issues or the ability to delegate voting power on specific topics to peers over a secure network without central authority. The goal is to guarantee the greatest amount of legitimacy in terms of participation while aiming to enforce the most efficient decision made by the crowd. By operating with tokens signaled on a blockchain, immediate audit rights can be granted to every voter without needing to provide access to servers or private infrastructure, thus making the system open and transparent for all. Our work is driven by open source software development practices and cooperates with key projects aiming to secure identity in decentralized environments including efforts from [https://blockstack.org/blockstack_usenix16.pdf Blockstack], [http://civic.com Civic] and [https://whitepaper.uport.me/uPort_whitepaper_DRAFT20170221.pdf Consensys] among others.

===1.1 Legacy.===

We can consider elections implemented by states, provinces and city municipalities as ''8 bit democracies''. If we consider each candidate a bit in the system then a citizen’s input during election day is limited to a few bits per cast vote. That’s the bandwidth of the so-called ''modern democracies''. Under these systems less than one percent of the population is able to vote on legislation or execute budgets while the rest are legally forced to outsource their full citizenship rights to a representing minority that eventually figures out how to perpetuate itself. The technology behind ''representative democracies'' can be grouped in two sets:

* '''Analogue elections''': usually paper ballots and ballot boxes with authorities responsible for counting votes and reporting fraudulent behavior. Even though these systems are stable in developed nations, they suffer from severe lack of participation. Barriers are implemented with requirements such as the need to register to vote through an excessively bureaucratic process that ends up blocking a majority of disenfranchised voters. Authorities also gerrymander districts exploiting survey data in anticipation of electoral outcomes. Even though these systems are easier to audit, this also means that they’re easier to corrupt: in developing nations ''analogue elections'' get subverted by mobs representing large parties that burn or disappear ballot boxes, threatening auditors from smaller competitors and letting violence overrun the process on key districts. In our experience with the [http://partidodelared.org Partido de la Red] running for the City Congress of Buenos Aires in the 2013 elections we found out that no effort mattered more than having sufficient party auditors to cover every district in the city or otherwise votes would get stolen. The larger an election’s territory is, the less likely an analogue system can guarantee a fair process. And the high implementation costs end up limiting elections to a handful of days per year (if any), rendering democracy an exception rather than the norm on how governments get elected.

[[File:/images/nation-state-voter-turnout.png|Territorial voting.]]

* '''Electronic voting''': proposals that deliver solutions based on electronic voting machines aim to secure the process through a digital interface yet the same logic of few elections per year legitimizing professional politicians is served. Machines can effectively help avoid [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clientelism clientelist] techniques used to corrupt an election but open a whole new surface of attack by exposing ballots to the risk of undetected hacks and foreign intervention. Experts on this field ([https://www.ndi.org/e-voting-guide/examples/constitutionality-of-electronic-voting-germany including the Supreme Court of Germany]) recommend using electronic voting machines that leave a paper trail [https://www.amazon.com/Voting-Wars-Florida-Election-Meltdown/dp/0300198248 or any alternative medium] for vote proof. But even if setup is to be trusted: the nature of computing systems to keep logs cannot guarantee vote secrecy. Any logging of a digital voting system should be public by default over a ledger syncing outputs using a distributed consensus mechanism on a shared network. In short: a blockchain.

Traditional analog and electronic elections are strictly for long term representative democracies with elective periods ranging from 4 to 6 years. But the underlying dynamic of these systems is that officials are already elected from the top-down and are only left for citizens to legitimize with their vote. The argument given is that citizens lack the knowledge and preparation to fulfill political responsibility and don’t have enough time in their daily lives to engage in public affairs. But more often than not public servants require the input from experts on specific fields to draft legislation and citizens do engage in a routine that has them debating on political issues on a daily basis albeit lacking any chances of genuine impact.

==2. Encryption.==

A consequence of the U.S. Presidential Election of 2016 is that the [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/16/qa-russian-hackers-vladimir-putin-donald-trump-us-presidential-election fear of foreign intervention] has become a leading threat to the security  of electoral processes. But foreign attacks rarely consist on hijacking voting machines: directly manipulating votes can be easily traced and it is very expensive to impact on a scale large enough to satisfy an attacker. A more efficient approach is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack instilling public fear by collapsing internet infrastructure days prior to an election] in a way that can help push favoritism on a candidate that is perceived stronger than the other one. This kind of cyberattack able to trigger a shift in voter perception is nearly impossible to trace as political subversion and reveals the inherent conflict that a digital commons has with territorial democracies.

===2.1 Land versus Cloud.===

The 21st Century is witnessing a growing conflict between ''The Land'': governments that monopolize the law on territorial jurisdictions by restricting the free movement of physical goods and bodies; and ''The Cloud'': corporations that monopolize access to user data able to track and target ideas via personalized advertising. In this world freedom is an illusion: our bodies belong to governments, our minds to corporations. Notorious battles from this conflict include the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute ''Apple versus FBI''] case requesting the jailbreak of an encrypted phone; or the historical dispute between [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/03/06/trumps-new-travel-ban-raises-the-same-silicon-valley-objections/?utm_term=.0854c54536d6 Silicon Valley’s cosmopolitanism seeking flexible visas and Washington D. C.’s nationalism raising migration barriers]. As this scenario unfolds, encryption plays a role of growing significance to protect the human rights of digital citizens as it can help them break apart from the ''cloud versus land'' trap.

[[File:/images/the-cloud.png|The cloud: monopolies on data.]]

The origins of digital cryptography goes back to World War II when Alan Turing built the first proto-computers to decrypt Nazi messages. Since then encryption has been legislated in the USA in the same manner kept for traditional weapons: it is included in the Munitions List of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and related software and hardware must deal with export restrictions. And even though encryption is often considered a right protected under the First Amendment arguing that “code is speech”, its defensive nature indicates that it must also be protected under the umbrella of the Second Amendment since it holds  the same reasoning behind  the “right to bear arms”: In an era where whistleblowers are revealing how the Deep State spies on citizens anywhere around the globe, encrypted information is the only realistic guarantee that anyone has to be protected from government abuses (and the corporations that back them).

Secrecy is a fundamental property of free and fair elections as it is a mechanism that helps avoid coercion from those in power and prevents the risk of elections being bought and sold for money. Privacy is the best guarantee a conscious free mind can have to think for itself. But on the modern internet: privacy is illusory wheb using Facebook, Google or any web based service. Even though they pretend being the gatekeepers of online privacy, theoretically Facebook can still impersonate any of its 2 Billion registered users if they ever wanted to. They hold the largest set of identities in the world surpassing the governments of India and China. And the fact that 97% of the reported revenue from Google and Facebook comes from advertising severely conditions the experience that users get with their technology. It is in their interest to gather as much information as possible to profile people in order to stay competitive in the attention market. And both companies filter information fed to users with algorithms accountable to anyone but their own board. None of their services are really free: personal sovereignty is given away in the same way the natives in the american continent got distracted watching their own selfies in shiny mirrors 500 years ago while the european conquistadors swept their entire way of life at a whim. Uncensored, free and sovereign debates on the future of humanity are being eaten by useless likes that only help perpetuate these internet monopolies. And Fake news exploits (as they were used during the U.S. elections) or content spreading like wildfire (as it happened during the Arab Spring) demonstrates that any effort to stop international influence on national politics is futile as societies spend their time online.
