2.3.2 Delegations.
A liquid bar also displays the vote delegation relation a user has with any other member of an organization. 
Delegations go both ways:

Sent: A user must be able to delegate any of his available votes while checking the current delegated amount (if any).
发送：用户必须可以
Received: A user must be able to understand how many votes were received from someone else.
Every time a member profile is displayed on Sovereign, the current delegation status between the user and the member
is shown.
接收：用户必须可以能够知道得到别人多少投票，在Sovereign的用户信息界面，显示当前的用户与成员的投票状态
