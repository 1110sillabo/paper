A probabilistic score to detect Sybil participants in blockchain networks =
“It is important to differentiate between verifying an identity, and verifying  the right to use a technology” Edward Snowden, Berlin 2019.



==i. Abstract.==

Blockchain networks opened the possibility of new institutional models built with open source code, able to resist censorship and scale participation globally. However, Bitcoin’s original White Paper description of [https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf “one-CPU-one-vote”] shaped the industry to think governance centered around machines, not people. Although a fundamental right to privacy bent early blockchain design towards anonymity, the lack of a robust notion of unique identity [https://www.evanvanness.com/post/184616403861/aragon-vote-shows-the-perils-of-onchain-governance renders its governance practices into plutocracies]: membership is often defined by stake ownership, enabling large holders to swing votes according to their preferences.

What is needed is a credential solution that protects privacy by taking as a principle the guideline described by Edward Snowden during 2019 Web3 Summit in Berlin: “It is important to differentiate between verifying an identity, and verifying the right to use a technology”. As individuals interweave their intellects with digital neural networks, the continuum between the semantics of people and organizations becomes increasingly elusive. In that sense, the nature of identity understood as the atomic expression of individuals embodied in a single human can be expanded to encompass [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3375436. social and intersectional markers]. Replica is a probabilistic score detecting Sybil participants in blockchain networks: it assigns every address with a 'Replica' status by default, and compute metrics that point towards increased uniqueness, drawing from the intersection of DAOs in which any given address is a member, as well as their relative presence in the social graph of blockchain-based transactions. Replica addresses the question of "Who verifies the verifier?" by creating an intersubjective space that combines a subjective function providing legitimacy to DAOs based on Quadratic Voting, and an objective function that applies the Gini Coefficient to measure the democratic virtue of any DAO existing on the Ethereum blockchain.

This text is structured in three parts, each aiming to satisfy a different readership target (and all of whom may reside within the same persona.)

* [[#Manifesto|Manifesto]]: For idealists. Diagnoses global political context and argues for a paradigm change.

* [[#Paper|Paper]]: For builders. Describes the building blocks for a system that can be implemented by anyone, anywhere.

* [[#Execution|Execution]]: For pragmatists. Specifies how to execute these ideas for impact.

We do not intend this text to remain fixed. It is published under an open source license and we welcome contributions from anyone, as our goal is for this document to be a living roadmap for planetary governance. Democracy as the ability to trust each other to the greatest possible extent is a defining force shaping the trajectory of history. Our mission echoes urgently across the globe, encompassing all of humanity: the need to make our shared home a place of peaceful coexistence. The [http://democracy.earth Democracy Earth Foundation] has performed [[#Background|extensive research]] on voting systems, cyberpolitics and blockchain networks; we stand at the forefront of a public conversation regarding the internet as a planetary jurisdiction.

Following [https://twitter.com/lsukernik/status/892101885771034628 the example of Satoshi Nakamoto], prior to sharing our ideas in written form we have undertaken to write code first, in order to properly understand what can be done. To this end, more than [https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/sovereign 30,000 lines of code have been written since October 2015], which in turn has driven our research, use cases, and the ideas presented herein. This is our proposal.
