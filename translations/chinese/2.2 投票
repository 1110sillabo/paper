2.2 Voting.

The vote token aims to be a standard for digital democracy able to interoperate with other tokens, setting a common 
language for the governance of blockchain based organizations. Within the context of liquid democracies, a range of 
voting transactions is permitted with votes:

Direct Vote: Selfish voter Alice is allowed to use her tokens to vote directly on issues as in a direct democracy.
直接投票：个体使用自己的token直接表达某项事务的看法。
Basic Delegation: Alice may delegate votes to Bob. As long as Bob has access to those tokens he can use them to vote 
on Alice's behalf.
基础代表制度：Alice可以委托Bob替他投票，只要Bob有权限使用这些token替Alice投票。
Tag Limited Delegation: Alice may delegate votes to Charlie under the specified condition that he can only use these 
tokens on issues carrying a specific tag. If the delegation specifies that delegated votes can only be used on decisions 
with the #environment tag, then Charlie won't be able to use these anywhere else but on those specific issues. This leads 
to a representation model not based on territory but on knowledge.
有限的代表制度：如果Alice允许Charlie在特定议题下代表自己投票。假设间接投票项目为“环境”标签，那么Charlie就无法使用Alice的token去“环境”之外的议题。
投票。这就形成了一个基于知识而不是领地的代议模型。
Transitive Delegation: If Bob received votes from Alice, he can then delegate these to Frank. This generates a chain of 
delegations that helps empower specific players within a community. If Alice does not desire to have third parties receiving 
the votes she delegated to Bob, she can turn off the transitive setting on the delegation contract. Circular delegations 
(e.g. Alice receiving the tokens she sent Bob from Frank) are prohibited since the original allocation of votes from an 
organization to its members carries a signature indicating who is the sovereign owner of the votes.

Overriding Vote: If Bob already used the delegated votes he received from Alice but she has a different opinion on a given 
issue, as the sovereign owner of her votes Alice can always override Bob's decision. Voters always have the final word on 
any given decision with their original votes.

Public Vote: Often referred as the golden rule of liquid democracies, all delegators have the right to know how their 
delegate has voted on any given issue with their votes. In the same way congressmen votes are public, on liquid democracies 
competing delegates on any given tag have an incentive to build a public reputation based on their voting record in order 
to attract more delegations.


Secret Vote: A method able to guarantee vote transactions untraceable to the voter. This is indispensable in contexts of 
public elections held within large populations that have a high risk of coercion. Even if perfect secrecy on vote transaction 
is achieved, users can still be fingerprinted with exposed meta-data. For this reason, research on integration with 
blockchains designed for anonymous transactions with a proven track record is encouraged. This might include a mining 
fee to settle the vote transaction that can be either subsidized by the implementing organization or directly paid by 
voters. We recommend research and integration of secret votes with these blockchains:
Ethereum: uses precompiled contracts for addition and scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve alt_bn128, for pairing 
checks, which permit zk-SNARKs, also see here, as implemented in the Byzantium hard fork.
ZCash: implements shielded transactions using zero-knowledge proofs.
Monero: uses ring signatures with stealth addresses.
