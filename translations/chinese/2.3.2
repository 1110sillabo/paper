2.3.2 Delegations.
A liquid bar also displays the vote delegation relation a user has with any other member of an organization. Delegations 
go both ways:

Sent: A user must be able to delegate any of his available votes while checking the current delegated amount (if any).
Received: A user must be able to understand how many votes were received from someone else.
Every time a member profile is displayed on Sovereign, the current delegation status between the user and the member
is shown.
