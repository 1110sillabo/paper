## Translation coordination

In order to distribute sections to translate between translate we created an online spreadsheet to keep track of :
- What sections need translations
- Who is translate what

Access translation [coordination spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fB0-5RKyFFXbASLuW1esZG34NACAAWWeiocnbRs5Rcs/)

## Steps to follow

1. Claim a section to translate by putting your name in "Claimed by column"
2. Fill "When expected to be done?"
3. Submit translation via Github pull request (here is a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lN1RAU2IHU&feature=youtu.be) on how to do it) if you don't want to go through the github process you can send your translation to vir@democracy.earth

Feel more like reviewing existing translation? No worries go over same process but in review mode :)
