User Experience.
用户体验
User Experience (UX) is a critical aspect of a decentralized architecture and becomes even more important as the 
redundant layers of centralized architectures condense to the user. In a centralized internet architecture, 
the user does not own the interface or experience. In a decentralized internet architecture, the user interface (UI) 
should be based on the user's perspective. In this sense, transactions get done under three distinct views:
用户体验在一个去中心化架构系统中扮演中重要角色，甚至超过中心化架构冗余层
Self: Using a public identity related to an individual.
Organization: In representation of an organization that extended representation rights to individuals (e.g. workplace, club, political party, etc).
Anonymous: Without any connection to a public identity.
This understanding of SELF / ORG / ANON shape-shifting requirement highly influenced our interface and token design. At any given time a Sovereign user can adopt any of these modes to interact with decentralized organizations.
