It is the technology that we do not control the one that is used to control us.
这是一项技术，一项不是用来奴役人类的技术。--Emiliano Kargieman, space hacker

A foundational principle of democracy is the right to be heard. Today most of the world’s population is not heard: 
民主基本原则之一是发言权，当今社会，世界上绝大多数的人没有发言权

每个人呱呱坠地，但是进入社会后，他被不透明的政治规则“被沉默”了，边缘化的群体在政治或经济社会中被禁声。

Direct democracy vs. Liquid Democracy.
直接民主 vs Liquid 民主
A liquid democracy is based on a dynamic representation model that works with a bottom-up approach: citizens are able to 
freely elect within their social graph (friends, colleagues, family) who they want to have as representatives on a specific 
set of topics. 
liquid 民主是基于自下而上的动态权益代表模型的，市民可以自由地从他的社交群（朋友，同事，家人）里挑选他在某议题的权益代表。
It is the most flexible form of democratic governance that can be constructed with digital technology,

operating as a hybrid that enables direct or delegated voting at any time. There are few precedents of trustworthy bottom-up 
environments that have led to authoritative content, Wikipedia being a pioneering case. But if history is any guide, the 
last time civilization faced a paradigm shift regarding encyclopedic enlightment it was precisely in the epoch preceding 
the rise of modern democracies.

最后一次面临着关于百科全书启蒙的范式转变，正是在此之前的时代现代民主形式的崛起。

operates with blockchain tokens using a basic set of smart contracts. Simplicity in the design and language used to express 
this design matters for the purpose of a genuinely democratic device. No technology will ever be able to satisfy democratic 
aspirations if it can only be understood by an elite. As cryptographer Ralph Merkle stated:
设计的设计语言的简单性对于真民主APP而言至关重要，如果只有塔尖精英才能理解它，那么任何高端技术都无法达到民主理想

密码学家Ralph Merkle说道：
We do not call upon ordinary untrained citizens to perform surgery, fly airplanes, design computers, or carry out the other 
myriad tasks needed to keep society functioning, what makes governance different? The problem is readily understood: if we 
give governance to “experts” they will make decisions in their own best interests, not in the best interests of us all.
我们不会将毫无培训经历的人放到医生，飞行员，计算机设计或其他
