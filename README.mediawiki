=The Social Smart contract.=
An Initial Rights Offering from [http://democracy.earth Democracy Earth Foundation].

===Abstract.===

The lack of contemporaneous political systems able to address citizens’ needs without corrupted mechanisms requires to build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete. On this paper we propose how to organize society and eradicate the corruption of traditional governments by connecting public resources to a democratic system using smart contracts. As humanity approaches Earth’s [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_capacity carrying capacity] with an expected population of 10 billion by 2100 we see indispensable the creation of a blockchain based organization for planetary governance that can guarantee preservation of life and natural resources in an age where [https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464310 intelligence is breaking apart from organisms]. We detail how to build a blockchain based democracy on a networked commons enforceable with encryption and we offer a path to fund this decentralized government with a rights offering mechanism (analogous to Initial Coin Offerings) that will use its assets to strengthen the political role of the internet across all jurisdictions.

==1. Introduction.==
Current democratic systems governing societies under the territorial domain of Nation-States have grown stagnant in terms of participation and are leading towards increased polarization. Constituencies are provided with tailor-made media that satisfies their own endogamic beliefs, pulling society apart as discourse has factual debate replaced by a post-truth mindset. This is a consequence of the drastic expansion in communication channels that shrank attention spans rendering thoughtful analysis expendable. Instances of political participation in the so-called modern democracies are not apt for information abundant contexts and have remained without change since their inception.
