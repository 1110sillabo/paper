2.2 Voting.

The vote token aims to be a standard for digital democracy able to interoperate with other tokens, setting a common 
language for the governance of blockchain based organizations. Within the context of liquid democracies, a range of 
voting transactions is permitted with votes:

Direct Vote: Selfish voter Alice is allowed to use her tokens to vote directly on issues as in a direct democracy.
直接投票：个体使用自己的token直接表达某项事务的看法。
Basic Delegation: Alice may delegate votes to Bob. As long as Bob has access to those tokens he can use them to vote 
on Alice's behalf.
基础代表制度：Alice可以委托Bob替他投票，只要Bob有权限使用这些token替Alice投票。
Tag Limited Delegation: Alice may delegate votes to Charlie under the specified condition that he can only use these 
tokens on issues carrying a specific tag. If the delegation specifies that delegated votes can only be used on decisions 
with the #environment tag, then Charlie won't be able to use these anywhere else but on those specific issues. This leads 
to a representation model not based on territory but on knowledge.
有限的代表制度：如果Alice允许Charlie在特定议题下代表自己投票。假设间接投票项目为“环境”标签，那么Charlie就无法使用Alice的token去“环境”之外的议题。
投票。这就形成了一个基于知识而不是领地的代议模型。
Transitive Delegation: If Bob received votes from Alice, he can then delegate these to Frank. This generates a chain of 
delegations that helps empower specific players within a community. If Alice does not desire to have third parties receiving 
the votes she delegated to Bob, she can turn off the transitive setting on the delegation contract. Circular delegations 
(e.g. Alice receiving the tokens she sent Bob from Frank) are prohibited since the original allocation of votes from an 
organization to its members carries a signature indicating who is the sovereign owner of the votes.
传递性授权：
  如果Bob收到Alice的投票，他可以传递给Frank，这就生成了一个链式反应：将某个人得能量在一个社区中放大；如果Alice不希望Bob将自己的票传递给
  第三方，她可以在合约中关闭这个转递设定；环形传递是不允许的（例如A->B->F->A），因为组织下发的票上有原始分配对象的签名。
Overriding Vote: If Bob already used the delegated votes he received from Alice but she has a different opinion on a given 
issue, as the sovereign owner of her votes Alice can always override Bob's decision. Voters always have the final word on 
any given decision with their original votes.
覆盖投票：
  如果Alice转给Bob一票，但是Alice在某个事物上与Bob意见不同，那么Alice有权覆盖Bob的决定。即：票的原始所有者对她的投票决定有最终意见选择权。
Public Vote: Often referred as the golden rule of liquid democracies, all delegators have the right to know how their 
delegate has voted on any given issue with their votes. In the same way congressmen votes are public, on liquid democracies 
competing delegates on any given tag have an incentive to build a public reputation based on their voting record in order 
to attract more delegations.

投票结果公开性：
  又被称作liquid民主的黄金准则，所有的委托投票人员有权知道他们的票最终投向哪个意见。同样的道理议员们的投票是公开的，在liquid民主中，被委托
  人对于不同问题的投票都是公开展示的，这可以为他们吸引更多的委托人。

Secret Vote: A method able to guarantee vote transactions untraceable to the voter. This is indispensable in contexts of 
public elections held within large populations that have a high risk of coercion. Even if perfect secrecy on vote transaction 
is achieved, users can still be fingerprinted with exposed meta-data. For this reason, research on integration with 
blockchains designed for anonymous transactions with a proven track record is encouraged. This might include a mining 
fee to settle the vote transaction that can be either subsidized by the implementing organization or directly paid by 
voters. We recommend research and integration of secret votes with these blockchains:

投票者隐私：
  一个保证投票人无法被追踪的方法，这在人口众多，存在强迫投票可能性的公开投票中是不可或缺的。尽管目前反追踪工作已经取得较好的成果，仍可以通过
  原数据的指纹追踪到投票人。出于这个原因，我们鼓励通过区块链技术让投票者匿名。这可能会涉及到一些少量的费用保障投票，可以由组织机构或者投票人
  直接支付，我们推荐用如下区块链方式集成匿名投票：

Ethereum: uses precompiled contracts for addition and scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve alt_bn128, for pairing 
checks, which permit zk-SNARKs, also see here, as implemented in the Byzantium hard fork.
以太坊：在椭圆曲线alt bn128上使用预编译的智能合约进行加法和标量乘法，允许zk-SNARKs用于配对检查，在Byzantium分支中实现的。
ZCash: implements shielded transactions using zero-knowledge proofs.
ZCash:零知识门槛的安全交易保障

Monero: uses ring signatures with stealth addresses.
门罗币：使用具有秘密地址的环签名
