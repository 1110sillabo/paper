==i. Abstract.==

Blockchain networks opened the possibility of new institutional models built with open source code, able to resist censorship and scale participation globally. However, Bitcoin’s original White Paper description of [https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf “one-CPU-one-vote”] shaped the industry to think governance centered around machines, not people. Although a fundamental right to privacy bent early blockchain design towards anonymity, the lack of a robust notion of unique identity [https://www.evanvanness.com/post/184616403861/aragon-vote-shows-the-perils-of-onchain-governance renders its governance practices into plutocracies]: membership is often defined by stake ownership, enabling large holders to swing votes according to their preferences.

What is needed is a credential solution that protects privacy by taking as a principle the guideline described by Edward Snowden during 2019 Web3 Summit in Berlin: “It is important to differentiate between verifying an identity, and verifying the right to use a technology”. As individuals interweave their intellects with digital neural networks, the continuum between the semantics of people and organizations becomes increasingly elusive. In that sense, the nature of identity understood as the atomic expression of individuals embodied in a single human can be expanded to encompass [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3375436. social and intersectional markers]. Replica is a probabilistic score detecting Sybil participants in blockchain networks: it assigns every address with a 'Replica' status by default, and compute metrics that point towards increased uniqueness, drawing from the intersection of DAOs in which any given address is a member, as well as their relative presence in the social graph of blockchain-based transactions. Replica addresses the question of *"Who verifies the verifier?"* by creating an intersubjective space that combines a subjective function providing legitimacy to DAOs based on Quadratic Voting, and an objective function that applies the Gini Coefficient to measure the democratic virtue of any DAO existing on the Ethereum blockchain.

==1. Introduction.==

Throughout the year of 2019, two phenomena in the blockchain ecosystem have fundamentally augmented the scope of metrics available for a probabilistic and multifactorial identity score: (i) the maturation of  governance contracts known as DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations); (ii) the emergence of different Proof of Humanity protocols based on Turing Tests and Web-of-Trust schemes — each having clear trade-offs on the feasibility to establish a scalable long term solution to the problem. 

'''DAOs — Decentralized Autonomous Organizations''': The DAO acronym refers to a class of smart contracts devised to automate the execution of organizational governance and decision-making. This institutional modality emerged as a possibility due to the creation of [https://ethereum.org/ Ethereum], a blockchain network that permits Turing-complete computations, leading to the growth of smart contract development. By deploying DAO contracts into the Ethereum blockchain, organizations allow their participants to maintain real-time control of funds, and vote on its subsequent allocation with governance rules that are formalized, automated and enforced by the conditions encoded into its smart contract. 

While traditional smart contracts are aimed mostly at delivering automated outcomes as they perform financial functions; DAOs differ by structuring a set of decisions that cannot be automated away and instead require some form of conscious attention for their functioning. Being intended for governance, they imprint human entropy on chain, offering a promising path as a substrate for [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-sybil-attack/ anti-Sybil solutions]. Examples of DAO contracts with parameters applicable as inputs for the Replica oracle include [https://molochdao.com/ MolochDAO], [https://daostack.io/ DAOstack], [https://kleros.io/ Kleros Courts] and [https://aragon.org/ Aragon DAOs], as well the recent efforts to standardize contracts that enable legal compliance by nonprofit and political organizations led by [http://www.peepsdao.com/ PeepsDAO], and for-profit ventures, led by [https://www.thelao.io/ The LAO]. Additional sources of trust can be included by allowing token swaps with other non-EVM protocols such as Idena Network, or authentication technologies from the Web 2.0 (Facebook et al.) and Nation States. 

'''WOT (Web of Trust) using TCRs (Token Curated Registries)''': Web of Trust schemes consist of identity certificates that can be digitally signed by other users who, by that act, endorse the association of their own public key with the person or entity listed in the certificate. Adding crypto economic incentives to a Web of Trust is the use of a Token Curated Registry where curators can benefit from proper membership validation. While that prevents the centralization of validators, the possibility of dishonest participants taking over the graph presents a challenge. Examples of projects utilizing this model include [https://www.humanitydao.org/ HumanityDAO] and [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z01MS0-h75ESVmWymU2Gv3Z43p35oZAFtQLStOeu7Ek/edit  Kleros' upcoming Proof of Humanity video platform]. 

'''Machine Learning Resistant Turing Tests''': A machine's perception threshold can be measured using Turing Tests: tasks designed to tell robots from humans apart. Therefore, a Proof of Humanity consensus requires new forms of the CAPTCHA test, demanding specific tests of human processing capability that cannot be matched by machine learning. Such an approach has been suggested by Vitalik Buterin in theorizing a solution to the Sybil Attack problem with [https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Problems/89fd07ffff8b042134e4ca67a0ce143d574016bd "a proof-of-work algorithm dominated by human labor and not computers"], and has recently been applied by the [http://idena.io/ Idena Network], as it outlines a novel way of achieving Proof of Personhood by making the resolution of machine learning resistant proofs synchronous. 

Idena implements a live event held over its entire network, where participants are required to simultaneously solve FLIP tests. A FLIP test consists of picking between two sets of the same images disposed in different order, where one makes sense as a story, and the other doesn't. Solving a FLIP requires a semantic interpretation of the relationship between objects, which is common sense for humans but difficult for computers: [ https://idena.io/IdenaPitchDeck.pdf the average AI accuracy on solving a set of FLIPs is 69%, while Human accuracy is at 95%]. Given that tests cannot be captured by existing machine learning, Idena successfully provides a Proof of Personhood. It is not a strictly anti-Sybil solution, since there is a probabilistic margin of error: although highly unlikely, a person with exceptional ability could solve more than one set of FLIPS within their allotted time and earn more than one credential within the network. 

However, Idena demonstrates that "liveness" — a synchronous event  — can play a critical role in Sybil prevention, as the time constraint prevents a single entity from solving more than a few sets of FLIPs. Such a method enables a modality of validation that involves no data point except that of proof of conscious cognitive ability. The tradeoff is a significantly high coordination cost to achieve recurrent, simultaneous solving of FLIPS: all nodes must continuously participate in the synchronous events, otherwise their identities expire.

==2. Replica.==

As the blockchain ecosystem is converging on smart contracts standardizing the structuring of organizations and identities, Democracy Earth Foundation is constructing an algorithm able to output a probabilistic score for Proof of Humanity to all addresses interacting on chain, facilitating democratic governance and preserving privacy. Replica is designed in the same way that algorithms like PageRank (developed by Google in 1997) were once created to make sense of the web. It serves as a proxy to estimate the chances of any given address corresponding to a single human participant within the network.

Drawing from the social ontology of John Searle, Replica takes identity under a lens of intersubjectivity. Searle proposes that contemporary society is permeated by invisible, but pervasive, [ https://www.amazon.es/Making-Social-World-Structure-Civilization/dp/0195396170 "status functions"], which are intersubjective entities that emerge from the interdependence of a two-level ontology of facts. The lower level concerns objective, brute facts — independent of human subjectivity — while the upper level concerns institutional facts that rely on some form of  ‘collective intentionality'. Examples are money, property, governments, marriages, stock markets and cocktail parties. 

Current blockchain-based identity certifications may be categorized as strictly objective: they consist of cryptographically signed statements that go no further than timestamping a hash with an encryption algorithm. The failure to provide an input for subjectivity accounts for a central challenge: the inability to address the question of *"Who verifies the verifier?"*. Looking at identity outside of the scope of centralized or governmental verification, requires the construction of new status functions embedded in collective intentionality that can substitute for the shared subjectivity legitimizing former sources of validation.

Replica is designed to create an intersubjective space able to address this need, accounting for measurements of both 'collective intentionalities' and 'brute facts' by combining a subjective function that provides legitimacy to the score based on Quadratic Voting, and an objective function that measures the Gini Coefficient of any DAO existing on the Ethereum blockchain. It will create a Democratic Index and assign a score to every Ethereum address relative to the intersection of DAOs in which it belongs as a member or its position in the social graph of blockchain-based transactions. 

'''Democratic Index'''

'''Fig. 1''' Every address that belongs to a DAO will be weighted by Rrplica with a percentage of the Democratic Index obtained from the intersection of DAOs that constitute the identity of such address.

'''Fig. 2''' In order to counter weight false positives on the Gini Coefficient, addresses that achieve a high score will be granted the right to rank the different DAOs analyzed by the Replica oracle, according the their corresponding ability to ensure that no single Human controls more than one identifier within its domain. 

'''Fig. 3''' The Gini coefficient for democracy ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 representing perfect totalitarianism and 1 representing perfect democracy. It computes a score that measures the share distribution by each segment of addresses belonging to a DAO.

'''Fig. 4'''  A Democratic Index is calculated for each DAO, as a function of their position in the Quadratic Voting rank and their Gini Coefficient.
